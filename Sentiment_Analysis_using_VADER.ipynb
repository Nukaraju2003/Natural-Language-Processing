        "\n",
        "Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. VADER does not requires any training data but is constructed from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon. (A sentiment lexicon is a list of lexical features e.g., words, which are generally labelled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative.). VADER has been found to be quite successful when dealing with social media texts, editorials, movie reviews, and product reviews. This is because VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is."
